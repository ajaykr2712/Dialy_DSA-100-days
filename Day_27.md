Best Information on ML Algorithms
Overview
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are the backbone of data science and artificial intelligence. They can be broadly categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms. Here’s a curated list of some of the most important ML algorithms:

Supervised Learning
Linear Regression 📈

Use Case: Predicting continuous values.
Example: Predicting house prices.
Logistic Regression 🧩

Use Case: Binary classification problems.
Example: Spam detection.
Decision Trees 🌳

Use Case: Classification and regression tasks.
Example: Customer segmentation.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) ⚖️

Use Case: Classification and regression.
Example: Image classification.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 👥

Use Case: Classification and regression.
Example: Recommendation systems.
Unsupervised Learning
k-Means Clustering 📊

Use Case: Grouping similar data points.
Example: Market segmentation.
Hierarchical Clustering 🌲

Use Case: Building nested clusters.
Example: Taxonomy of species.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 🧮

Use Case: Dimensionality reduction.
Example: Image compression.
Anomaly Detection 🚨

Use Case: Identifying rare events.
Example: Fraud detection.
Reinforcement Learning
Q-Learning 🎮

Use Case: Learning policies for actions.
