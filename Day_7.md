**Activities:**
- 📝 Documented the steps for solving a problem on LeetCode.
- 📌 Practiced and refined the process to enhance problem-solving skills.

**Detailed Notes:**
- 📝 **Understand the Problem Statement 📝**
  - **Read Carefully:** Thoroughly read the problem statement and understand the requirements.
  - **Identify Inputs and Outputs:** Note down what inputs are provided and what the expected outputs are.
- 📝 **Analyze Constraints and Edge Cases 🔍**
  - **Check Constraints:** Understand the constraints provided (e.g., input size, value ranges).
  - **Think of Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases that might cause your solution to fail (e.g., empty inputs, maximum/minimum values).
- 📝 **Plan Your Approach 🧠**
  - **Choose a Strategy:** Decide on the algorithm or data structure that fits the problem (e.g., sorting, dynamic programming, hash tables).
  - **Break Down the Problem:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
- 📝 **Write Pseudocode ✍️**
  - **Draft Steps:** Write a high-level pseudocode to outline the steps of your solution.
  - **Ensure Logic Flow:** Make sure your pseudocode logically flows and covers all scenarios.
- 📝 **Implement the Solution 💻**
  - **Start Coding:** Translate your pseudocode into actual code.
  - **Use Comments:** Comment your code to make it easier to understand.
- 📝 **Test Your Solution 🧪**
  - **Run Sample Tests:** Use sample test cases provided in the problem statement to check your solution.
  - **Test Edge Cases:** Manually create and test additional edge cases.
- 📝 **Optimize if Necessary 🚀**
  - **Check Efficiency:** Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
  - **Optimize:** If your solution is not efficient, consider optimizing it (e.g., using a different algorithm, reducing redundant computations).

**Code Snippets:**
```python
# Example problem solution
def example_function(inputs):
    # Start coding: Translate your pseudocode into actual code
    # Use comments to make it easier to understand
    pass
