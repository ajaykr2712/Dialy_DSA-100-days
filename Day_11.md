Copy code
# Two Sum solution in Python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    hashmap = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in hashmap:
            return [hashmap[complement], i]
        hashmap[num] = i
Reflections:

🤔 Understanding array manipulation is fundamental and will help in more complex data structures.
🚀 Solving problems on different platforms provided diverse perspectives on similar problems.
Next Steps:

🔜 Continue solving more array problems.
🔜 Start learning about linked lists.
